## Overview
Natural disasters are take a lot of lives and burdens the country's economy. Many of the disasters could be prevented if there is a better communication and swift recovery can be possible if we can handle the disaster situation properly. Many lives could be saved if we can manage the disasters properly . 
In this context we have come up with innovative ideas to alert people(pre-disaster), and ensure proper management of the disasters.

We propose a software approach to handle the situations better. We develop mobile applications and web applications to tackle the problem.

Following are the features and ideas that will be delivered : 

Pre-Disaster-Alerts:
	Often there is no proper communication before the disasters. For instance recently, the Kerala floods were predicted in early August by IMD but it was not communicated properly

	.During the Pre disaster time, we can alert people and create awareness to reduce the impact of the disaster. 
	Weather forecasting and natural disaster prediction itself is a very complicated models. For example rainfall depends on Air currents, pressure variations. Also low lying areas get flooded easily.
	We propose a combination of web scraping techniques and actual forecasts by weather agencies to alert the people in an area.
	We scrape data from weather forecast agencies such as imd to prepare a metric which tells the client how safe he is
	We also provide a portal in which the weather agencies themselves can send immediate alert messages.

Disaster management techniques:
	We propose the following management techniques which can potentially save a lot of lives:

	Rescue Operations
	1. Rescue team formation- People will be able to for and join rescue teams to help reach out to victims
	2. People will be able to donate basic resources which will be collected by some team.
	3. Rescue team will be able to view the locations of the nearest victims so that they can be saved.
	4. Rescue team will be able to view the surroundings of a victim so that he can better understand where the victim is located.
	5. Rescue team will be able to comminicate to the victims over SMS/messaging services based on the feasibility..

	Victims
	1. He can mark himself as safe or in danger.
	2. If the vicim is in danger then he'll be asked for the resources he needs.
	3. If the victim is in danger then he gets the nearest rescue group contacts and location, and nearest relief camp.
	4. A victim will be able to post images of other people in danger so that application can detect the number of faces and get approximate number of people stranded.
	5. A victim can post the areas of his surroundings so that rescuers can get to the place quickly.

	NGO's
	1. Registered NGOs can get to know how the rescue operation is carried out.
	2. They get a list of people who are willing to donate basic resources.

	Offline feature:
	The above features require some internet connection. But during natural disasters getting internet can be tough. So we propose relaying information via SMS which consume very less bandwidth compared to others. Even if the network is down , we will be able to transfer locations via SMS's.
